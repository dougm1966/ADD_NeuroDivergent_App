# ðŸŽ¤ Agent 0 Sprint 0B: Task Processing & Celebration

## Sprint Goal
Enhance task extraction and implement the celebration system for user accomplishments.

## Time Estimate
60-75 minutes

## Prerequisites
- Completed Sprint 0A
- Working voice recording/transcription
- Basic task extraction

## Critical Rules (NEVER VIOLATE)
1. Celebrate EVERY accomplishment
2. No task is too small
3. Energy-aware task processing
4. Gentle handoff to AGENT_1
5. User controls progression pace

## Sprint Tasks

### Task 1: Enhanced Task Processing
```typescript
interface EnhancedTaskProcessor {
  breakIntoMicroSteps(task: Task): MicroStep[];
  matchToEnergyLevel(steps: MicroStep[], energy: EnergyLevel): MicroStep[];
  suggestEasierAlternatives(task: Task): Alternative[];
}
```

### Task 2: Accomplishment Tracking
```typescript
interface AccomplishmentTracker {
  recordAccomplishment(task: Task, status: CompletionStatus): void;
  generateCelebration(accomplishment: Accomplishment): Celebration;
  trackProgress(userId: string): ProgressMetrics;
}
```

### Task 3: AGENT_1 Handoff Protocol
```typescript
interface Agent1Handoff {
  prepareHandoff(session: VoiceSession): HandoffPackage;
  validateReadiness(user: User): ProgressionStatus;
  initiateHandoff(package: HandoffPackage): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Task 4: User Progression System
```typescript
interface ProgressionSystem {
  checkReadiness(user: User): ProgressionStatus;
  suggestNextFeature(status: ProgressionStatus): Feature;
  trackEngagement(user: User): EngagementMetrics;
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Enhanced task extraction works
- [ ] Celebration system is engaging
- [ ] AGENT_1 handoff is smooth
- [ ] User progression is tracked
- [ ] All interactions remain shame-free

## Validation Commands
```bash
# Test task processing
npm run test:task-processing

# Verify celebration system
npm run test:celebrations

# Test AGENT_1 handoff
npm run test:handoff
```

## What AGENT_1 Needs
- Complete voice session data
- Extracted tasks with energy levels
- User progression status
- Accomplishment history

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't rush user progression
- Don't skip celebrations
- Don't force feature adoption
- Don't ignore energy levels
