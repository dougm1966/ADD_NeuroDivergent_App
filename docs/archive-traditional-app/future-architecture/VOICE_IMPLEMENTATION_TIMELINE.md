### Handoff Procedures

#### Pre-Foundation â†’ AGENT_0
```typescript
interface PreFoundationHandoff {
  expoSetup: boolean;
  voiceCapabilities: boolean;
  supabaseConnection: boolean;
  typeScriptSetup: boolean;
}
```

#### AGENT_0 â†’ AGENT_1
```typescript
interface VoiceHandoff {
  voiceSessions: VoiceSession[];
  taskExtraction: TaskExtraction;
  energyPatterns: EnergyMetrics;
  userProgression: ProgressionStage;
}
```

#### AGENT_1 â†’ AGENT_2-4
```typescript
interface EnhancedHandoff {
  voiceFoundation: VoiceSystem;
  brainState: BrainStateTracking;
  navigation: NavigationSystem;
  errorHandling: ErrorBoundary;
  testing: TestInfrastructure;
}
```

## Risk Management

### Dependency Risks
1. Voice System Failure
   - Fallback: Text input mode
   - Recovery: Voice system reset
   - Mitigation: Daily testing

2. Data Flow Breaks
   - Fallback: Local storage
   - Recovery: Data sync procedure
   - Mitigation: Flow monitoring

3. Performance Issues
   - Fallback: Reduced features
   - Recovery: Performance optimization
   - Mitigation: Regular benchmarking

### Critical Path Protection
1. Voice Functionality
   - Daily regression tests
   - User feedback monitoring
   - Performance tracking

2. Brain State Tracking
   - Data validation checks
   - Correlation monitoring
   - Accuracy metrics

3. User Experience
   - Flow testing
   - Error rate monitoring
   - Satisfaction tracking

## Emergency Procedures

### Dependency Failure Response
1. Identify failure point
2. Activate fallback system
3. Implement recovery procedure
4. Validate restoration
5. Document incident

### Rollback Procedures
1. Identify safe checkpoint
2. Execute rollback script
3. Verify system state
4. Restore user data
5. Resume operations
