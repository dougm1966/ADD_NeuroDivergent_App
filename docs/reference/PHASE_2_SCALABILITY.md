## Phase 2 Features Overview

Phase 2 builds upon the solid foundation of Phase 1's brain state system and adaptive task management by adding gamification, body doubling, and advanced social features. All Phase 2 features maintain the neurodivergent-first principles of being shame-free, adaptive, and optional.

## Core Phase 2 Features

### 1. üéØ **Gamification System**

#### Brain State Achievement System
**Purpose**: Reward self-awareness and consistency, not performance or "good" brain states

**Implementation**:
- **"Brain Scientist" Badges**: Earned for total check-ins (not streaks)
  - Bronze: 10 check-ins
  - Silver: 50 check-ins  
  - Gold: 100 check-ins
  - Platinum: 365 check-ins
- **"Self-Awareness" Points**: Bonus points for adding context notes
- **"Pattern Explorer" Achievement**: For experiencing full range of energy levels (1-10)
- **Visual Progress**: Gentle progress indicators, never countdown timers

**Neurodivergent Benefits**:
- Celebrates awareness regardless of brain state levels
- No streaks to break or maintain
- Validates the effort of self-monitoring
- Encourages long-term pattern recognition

**Database Extensions**:
```sql
-- Add to user_subscriptions table
ALTER TABLE user_subscriptions ADD COLUMN achievements JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
ALTER TABLE user_subscriptions ADD COLUMN achievement_points INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Achievement tracking
achievements: {
  "brain_scientist": {"level": "bronze", "earned_date": "2025-06-25"},
  "self_awareness": {"points": 15, "notes_added": 8},
  "pattern_explorer": {"ranges_experienced": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]}
}
```

#### Task Complexity Mastery
**Purpose**: Celebrate ALL productivity, especially validating low-energy accomplishments

**Implementation**:
- **Complexity-Specific Achievements**:
  - "Gentle Achiever" - Complete 10 Level 1 tasks
  - "Balanced Doer" - Complete 10 Level 3 tasks
  - "Challenge Champion" - Complete 5 Level 5 tasks
- **Energy-Matched Victories**: Special recognition for appropriate task selection
  - "Perfect Match" - Complete Level 2 task on Level 2 energy
  - "Gentle Victory" - Complete any task on Level 1-2 energy
  - "Peak Performance" - Complete Level 4+ task on Level 8+ energy

**Neurodivergent Benefits**:
- Validates micro-task completion on hard days
- Recognizes appropriate task selection (executive function success)
- No hierarchy of "better" achievements
- Celebrates working with brain patterns, not against them

#### Customization Unlocks
**Purpose**: Reward engagement with features that actually enhance user experience

**Implementation**:
- **Unlock Progression**:
  - Week 1: Basic theme variations
  - Month 1: Font options (including OpenDyslexic)
  - Month 3: Advanced sensory customizations
  - Month 6: Custom celebration animations
- **Body Doubling Rewards**: Enhanced customizations earned through body doubling participation
- **Brain State Rewards**: Special themes unlocked through consistent check-ins

**Neurodivergent Benefits**:
- Rewards improve actual app experience
- Sensory customizations enhance accessibility
- Optional progression that doesn't gate core functionality

### 2. üë• **Body Doubling Platform**

#### Three-Tier Access System

##### Tier 1: Drop-In Rooms

  - "Medium Energy Work Room" - Balanced co-working space
  - "High Energy Power Hour" - Active, dynamic sessions
  - "Creative Flow Room" - For creative and artistic tasks
  - "Admin Tasks Room" - For routine/organizational work
- **Features**:
  - Live room occupancy (1-6 people per room)
  - Join/leave anytime without disruption
  - Optional ambient sounds (rain, cafe, white noise)
  - Silent by default (no pressure to interact)

##### Tier 2: Matched Sessions
**Concept**: "Study buddy" pairing based on preferences and brain state

**Implementation**:
- **Matching Criteria**:
  - Brain state preference (same energy vs. complementary energy)
  - Session duration preference (25min, 50min, 90min)
  - Task type similarity (creative, admin, complex, simple)
  - Time zone compatibility
- **Matching Process**:
  - "Looking for a partner" notification
  - Algorithm suggests 2-3 potential matches
  - Both users confirm before session starts
  - Anonymous until both agree to connect

##### Tier 3: Scheduled Sessions
**Concept**: "Coffee date" style planned sessions with regular partners

**Implementation**:
- **Scheduling Features**:
  - Recurring sessions (daily, weekly, custom)
  - Brain state predictions for optimal scheduling
  - Gentle reminders without pressure
  - Easy rescheduling for brain state changes
- **Connection System**:
  - Upgrade from anonymous to connected users
  - First name visibility for regular partners
  - Mutual connection requests required

#### User Progression & Relationships

##### Anonymous Phase (Default)
- All users start anonymous
- Random avatars or initials only
- No personal information shared
- Focus purely on co-working

##### Familiar Phase (Organic Development)
- See same anonymous users multiple times
- Option to "recognize" frequent body doubling partners
- No obligation to connect

##### Connected Phase (Mutual Opt-In)
- Send/receive connection requests
- See first names of connected users
- Access to scheduled sessions together
- Gentle notifications about partner availability

#### Technical Architecture

##### Video Infrastructure
- **Primary Integration**: Agora.io or Daily.co APIs
- **Fallback Options**: WebRTC with TURN/STUN servers
- **Cost Management**: 
  - Free tier: 3 body doubling sessions per month
  - Premium tier: Unlimited sessions
- **Quality Controls**:
  - Automatic quality adjustment based on connection
  - Audio-only fallback for poor connections
  - Screen sharing optional (premium feature)

##### Room Management
```sql
-- Body doubling rooms and sessions
CREATE TABLE body_doubling_rooms (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  room_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'low_energy', 'high_energy', etc.
  current_occupancy INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  max_occupancy INTEGER DEFAULT 6,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE body_doubling_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  room_id UUID REFERENCES body_doubling_rooms(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  session_start TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  session_end TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  brain_state_at_start JSONB,
  satisfaction_rating INTEGER CHECK (satisfaction_rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5)
);

CREATE TABLE user_connections (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_1_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  user_2_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  connection_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending', -- 'pending', 'accepted', 'blocked'
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_1_id, user_2_id)
);
```

### 3. üîî **Advanced Notification System**

#### Brain State Adaptive Notifications
**Purpose**: Provide helpful reminders that respect current cognitive capacity

**Implementation**:
- **Timing Adaptation**:
  - High energy: More frequent, detailed notifications
  - Medium energy: Standard notification patterns
  - Low energy: Minimal, gentle notifications only
- **Language Adaptation**:
  - High energy: "Ready to check in and plan your productive day?"
  - Medium energy: "How are you feeling right now?"
  - Low energy: "Gentle check-in when you're ready"
- **Frequency Controls**:
  - User-defined quiet hours
  - Hyperfocus detection (no interruptions during task streaks)
  - Customizable reminder spacing (daily, every few days, weekly)

#### Social Notification System
**Purpose**: Enable body doubling coordination without social pressure

**Implementation**:
- **Anonymous Notifications**:
  - "3 people looking for body doubling partners right now"
  - "High Energy Power Hour starting in 10 minutes"
  - "Low Energy Focus Room has 2 people"
- **Connected User Notifications**:
  - "Sarah is starting a focus session" (from connections only)
  - "Your scheduled session with Alex begins in 15 minutes"
  - "Jamie completed a body doubling session and earned a new theme!"
- **Achievement Notifications**:
  - "You earned the Brain Scientist Bronze badge!"
  - "New customization unlocked: Calming Blue theme"
  - "Gentle Victory achieved for today's micro-task completion"

#### Notification Preferences & Controls

##### Granular Control System
```typescript
interface NotificationPreferences {
  brain_state_reminders: {
    enabled: boolean;
    frequency: 'daily' | 'every_few_days' | 'weekly';
    quiet_hours: { start: string; end: string };
    adaptive_language: boolean;
  };
  body_doubling: {
    room_availability: boolean;
    partner_invites: boolean;
    session_reminders: boolean;
    connected_user_activity: boolean;
  };
  achievements: {
    immediate_celebration: boolean;
    weekly_summary: boolean;
    unlock_notifications: boolean;
  };
  system: {
    app_updates: boolean;
    maintenance_notices: boolean;
    quota_warnings: boolean;
  };
}
```

##### Smart Notification Timing
- **Hyperfocus Detection**: No notifications during continuous app usage
- **Sleep Respect**: No notifications during user-defined sleep hours
