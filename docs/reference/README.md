# 📚 Reference Documentation

> **Purpose**: Forward-compatibility and architectural guidance for Phase 1 agents

## What's In This Folder

This folder contains **reference documentation** that guides Phase 1 architectural decisions to ensure seamless Phase 2 scaling without breaking changes.

### **Files Overview**

#### 🔮 [PHASE_2_SCALABILITY.md](PHASE_2_SCALABILITY.md)
**Purpose**: Detailed Phase 2 feature specifications that inform current architectural decisions
- **For Agent 2**: Database schema must support Phase 2 table extensions
- **For Agent 3**: Store architecture must accommodate Phase 2 state additions  
- **For Agent 4**: Design system must support Phase 2 UI elements
- **For All Agents**: Understand what's coming to build the right foundation

#### 🔄 [ARCHITECTURE_EVOLUTION.md](ARCHITECTURE_EVOLUTION.md)  
**Purpose**: Technical guide for how Phase 1 architecture evolves to Phase 2
- **Database Evolution**: How schema extends without breaking changes
- **API Evolution**: How services scale to new functionality
- **Component Evolution**: How UI components support new features
- **Integration Patterns**: How cross-agent communication scales

## How Agents Use This Folder

### **During Sprint Planning**
Reference these files when making architectural decisions that could impact future scalability.

### **During Implementation**
Consult when choosing between implementation approaches:
- "Which database design pattern supports Phase 2 better?"
- "How should I structure this component for future extensions?"
- "What TypeScript interfaces will be extensible?"

### **During Code Review**
Verify that implementation choices support Phase 2 scalability requirements.

## Usage Pattern

```
Current Work (Phase 1) + Future Requirements (Phase 2) = Scalable Architecture
```

**Example Decision Process**:
1. Agent 2 needs to design user_subscriptions table
2. Check `PHASE_2_SCALABILITY.md` for future columns needed
3. Design current table + JSONB fields for future extensions  
4. Result: Phase 1 works perfectly, Phase 2 requires only additive changes

## What This Is NOT

❌ **Not current implementation requirements** - Focus on main `/docs` files for current work  
❌ **Not immediate features to build** - These are future features for reference only  
❌ **Not detailed implementation guides** - These are architectural guidance documents
