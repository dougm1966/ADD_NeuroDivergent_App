**Example Breakdown**:
**Input**: "Clean the house" (Low Energy State)
**AI Output**:
1. Put on comfortable clothes (2 min)
2. Choose just one room to focus on (1 min)
3. Set a gentle 15-minute timer (1 min)
4. Pick up 5 things in that room (10 min)
5. Take a break and celebrate what you did! (5 min)

**Brain State Adaptations**:
- **Low Energy**: Micro-steps with frequent breaks, very encouraging language

### 4. Gentle Encouragement System
**Purpose**: Provide motivation without shame, pressure, or triggering RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria)

**User Story**: "As someone with RSD, I want encouragement that builds me up instead of making me feel guilty about what I haven't done."

**Language Principles**:

- **No streak counters** - removes pressure and guilt
- **No shame language** - avoid words like "failed", "missed", "behind"
- **Compassionate understanding** - acknowledges hard days are normal
- **Progress over perfection** - small wins matter

**Encouragement Examples**:
‚úÖ **Use**: "You did something today - that's wonderful!"
‚ùå **Avoid**: "You missed your streak!"

‚úÖ **Use**: "Ready to try again when you are"
‚ùå **Avoid**: "You're behind schedule"

‚úÖ **Use**: "Every small step counts"
‚ùå **Avoid**: "You only completed 2 out of 10 tasks"

**Implementation**:
- Celebration animations for completed tasks (gentle, not overwhelming)
- Encouraging messages based on brain state and energy level
- Weekly reflection prompts (optional, never mandatory)
- "Rest day" option that doesn't break any progress tracking
