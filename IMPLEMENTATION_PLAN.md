# ðŸ“‹ Implementation Plan - ADD NeuroDivergent App

## Overview
This document provides the exact sprint execution order and implementation strategy for building the ADD NeuroDivergent App using a multi-agent development approach.

**Critical Note**: This is planning documentation only. Do NOT start coding until all integration risks have been reviewed and addressed.

## Agent Dependency Chain

Based on AGENT_INTEGRATION.md analysis, the implementation must follow this exact order:

```
Agent 1 (Foundation) â†’ Agent 3 (Core Features)
Agent 2 (Backend)    â†’ Agent 3 (Core Features)  
Agent 4 (UI/UX)      â†’ Agent 3 (Core Features)
```

**All agents flow into Agent 3 as the final integration point.**

2. **Agent 2 Sprint 2B** - Database schema (BLOCKS Agent 3 stores)

### Can Run in Parallel (Week 2)
- Agent 3 Sprints 3A-3E (depends on Agent 1 & 2 completion)
- Agent 4 Sprints 4A-4E (can start independently)

### Final Integration (Week 3)
- Agent 4 completes UI components
- Agent 3 integrates Agent 4 components
- Final testing and validation

## Resource Requirements

### Development Environment
- Node.js 18+ with npm/yarn
- Expo CLI 6+ for React Native development
- Supabase CLI for backend deployment
- TypeScript 5+ for type safety
- Git for version control with branching strategy

### External Services
- **Supabase Project**: Database, authentication, and Edge Functions
- **OpenAI API Key**: For AI task breakdown (must be stored in Edge Functions)
- **Expo Development Build**: For testing native features

### Team Coordination
- **Agent Branches**: Each agent works on separate Git branches
- **Daily Handoffs**: Review integration points between agents
- **Shared Documentation**: Real-time updates to integration contracts

- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified
- [ ] Ready for user testing

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **Edge Function Deployment**: Test OpenAI integration early
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Validate exact interface matching between agents
- **AsyncStorage**: Test offline functionality thoroughly
- **Navigation Integration**: Verify screen transitions work correctly

### Integration Risks
- **Agent Handoff Points**: Document exact requirements and test interfaces
- **Brain State Adaptation**: Verify UI responds correctly to state changes
- **Freemium Integration**: Test subscription quota checking thoroughly

### Timeline Risks
- **Buffer Time**: Add 20% buffer to each sprint for unexpected issues
- **Parallel Development**: Ensure agents can work independently where possible
- **Early Integration Testing**: Test integration points as soon as both sides are ready

## Next Steps

1. **Review INTEGRATION_RISKS.md** - Understand potential failure points
2. **Review DEPENDENCIES_MAP.md** - Visualize exact agent dependencies  
3. **Review CRITICAL_PATH.md** - Identify what must be built in sequence
4. **Validate with all agents** - Ensure timeline and dependencies are realistic
5. **Begin Phase 1** - Start with Agent 1 Sprint 1A
