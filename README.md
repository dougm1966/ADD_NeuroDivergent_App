# 🧠 BrainPal: Voice-First ADHD Task Assistant

**Speak your overwhelm, get organized output, celebrate ANY accomplishment**

## 🎯 What Makes BrainPal Different

Unlike traditional task managers that create guilt, BrainPal works WITH your neurodivergent brain:

1. 🎙️ **Just Talk** - No need to organize your thoughts
   - Open app → Tap big button → Start talking
   - "Kitchen's a mess, work deadline tomorrow, need birthday gift..."

2. 🔄 **Energy-Aware Tasks** - Steps that match YOUR capacity
   - AI detects your energy level (1-10)
   - Breaks down tasks into tiny, doable steps
   - "Low energy detected (3/10). Let's start small:"
   - "Kitchen: Just load dishwasher (5 min)"

3. 🌟 **Celebrate Everything** - Did something? It counts!
   - Hit green button → Share what you actually did
   - ALL productivity celebrated (even unplanned)
   - "Took a shower and watched comfort show"
   - "Self-care wins! ✓ Hygiene ✓ Rest. Tasks can wait!"

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Real-time)
- **AI:** OpenAI API (GPT-4) for task processing

## 💡 Core Philosophy

**The Problem:** ADHD brains don't follow linear plans. We do important things (self-care, rest, spontaneous tasks) but feel guilty because they weren't "on the list."

**Our Solution:** 
- Voice-first input removes the executive function barrier
- AI adapts to your current energy level
- ALL productivity is celebrated
- No shame, no pressure, just support
