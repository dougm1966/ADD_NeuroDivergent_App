# Enhanced Features Discovered During Architecture Review

## 4-Layer Notification System (Evolved from 2)
1. **Data Layer** (Agent 2): When did they last check in?
2. **Logic Layer** (Agent 3): Should we notify based on their patterns?
3. **UI Layer** (Agent 4): How do we ask without triggering RSD?
4. **Device Layer** (Agent 1): Respect their quiet hours and preferences

## Brain State Adaptive UI (New Discovery)
- **Low Energy (1-3)**: Simplified UI, hide complex features, only show easy wins
- **Medium Energy (4-6)**: Standard UI with balanced options
- **High Energy (7-10)**: Full features, complex breakdowns, all options available

## What This Enables
- UI complexity matches cognitive capacity in real-time
- Prevents overwhelm during low-energy states
- Maximizes capability during high-energy states
- True cognitive accessibility

## Implementation Notes
- Need to define which UI elements hide/show at each level
- Consider transition animations (gentle, not jarring)
- Cache UI state to prevent flashing during loads
